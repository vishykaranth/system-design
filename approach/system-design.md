## System Design High Level 
- Understand Problem and Scope
    - Define the use cases, with interviewer's help
    - assume high availability is required, add as a use case
    - Recognize stakeholders and prioritize them. Create a RACI matrix
    - Understand business drivers of the project
    - Recognize end-users of the project and understand how they use that system
    - Check functional requirements
    - Define external dependencies
    - Suggest additional features
    - Remove items that interviewer considers out of scope
    - Detect Architecture Significant Requirements
    - Mix between FRs and NFRs to detect ASRs
- Think about constraints and non-functional requirements
    - (use PASS ME if you do not remember all of NFRs)
    - Recognize the number of users
    - Estimate users growth rate (for the next year/next five years)
    - Define average response time
    - Understand database size (current / for the next year/ for the next five years)
    - Understand storage size (current / for the next year/ for the next five years)
    - Recognize security needs
    - Define acceptable downtime of the system
    - Recognize the number of requests (per month/per second)
    - Estimate reads vs. writes operations percentage
    - Define time to market
    - Check customer related NFR: legacy/proprietary soft, etc
    - ask how many requests per month
    - ask how many requests per second (they may volunteer it or make you do the math)
    - estimate reads vs. writes percentage
    - keep 80/20 rule in mind when estimating
    - how much data written per second
    - total storage required over 5 years
    - how much data read per second    
- Abstract Design 
    - Choose which architectural views to define based on the stakeholders’ matrix. Use common C4/4+1/etc otherwise
    - Choose Architecture Style (Monolith, SOA — microservices, layered architecture, etc.)
    - Choose between cloud solution or on-premise servers
    - Consider authentication/authorization and privacy
    - Suggest security rules and protocols
    - Define infrastructure: load balancing, messaging
    - Make a rough overview of any critical algorithm that drives the service
    - Consider bottlenecks and determine solutions
    - Choose storage type (SQL or NoSQL)
    - Understand what data should be cached and how to improve performance/security/availability with caching
    - Choose monitoring system and logging. Analytics and automatically reboot the system in case of exceptions
    - Define separation between public and restricted areas
    - layers (service, data, caching)
    - infrastructure: load balancing, messaging
    - rough overview of any key algorithm that drives the service
    - consider bottlenecks and determine solutions
